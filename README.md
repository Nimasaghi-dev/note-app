# Note App

A simple and interactive web application for creating, editing, and managing notes. The app allows users to create notes, edit them in real-time, and delete them when no longer needed. All notes are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Add new notes with a single click.
- **Edit Notes**: Edit notes in real-time with a `contenteditable` interface.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes by clicking the delete icon.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are saved in the browser's local storage and persist across page reloads.
- **Line Breaks**: Pressing `Enter` inserts a line break instead of creating a new paragraph for better formatting.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for creating, editing, deleting, and saving notes.

## How to Use

1. **Create a Note**:
   - Click the "Create Note" button to add a new note.
   - Start typing to add content to the note.

2. **Edit a Note**:

3. **Delete a Note**:
   - Click the delete icon (üóëÔ∏è) in the bottom-right corner of the note to remove it.
